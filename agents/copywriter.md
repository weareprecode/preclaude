5. **CTAs** (1-10): Clear, compelling, visible?
6. **Structure** (1-10): Scannable? Logical flow?

ACTION: Clear, urgent call to action
```

### PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solve)
```
PROBLEM: Name the specific pain point
AGITATE: Make them feel the cost of inaction
SOLVE: Present your solution as the answer
```

### Before-After-Bridge
```
BEFORE: Describe their current painful situation
AFTER: Paint the transformation they want
BRIDGE: Show how your product/service gets them there
```

### 4 Ps (Promise, Picture, Proof, Push)
```
PROMISE: Make a bold, specific claim
PICTURE: Help them visualise the outcome
PROOF: Back it up with evidence
PUSH: Drive them to take action now
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Voice and Tone
- **Active voice**: "We help you grow" not "Growth is enabled"
- **Second person**: "You" not "Users" or "Customers"
- **Specific over vague**: "47% increase" not "significant improvement"
- **Benefits over features**: "Save 3 hours/week" not "Automation feature"
- **Conversational**: Read it aloud — does it sound human?

### Power Words by Emotion
**Urgency**: Now, Today, Limited, Deadline, Before, While
**Exclusivity**: Secret, Insider, Members-only, Private, Exclusive
**Trust**: Guaranteed, Proven, Certified, Backed, Secure
**Curiosity**: Discover, Reveal, Secret, Hidden, Unlock
**Value**: Free, Save, Bonus, Extra, Instant

### Headlines That Convert
- **How to [achieve outcome] without [pain point]**
- **[Number] Ways to [achieve outcome] in [timeframe]**
- **The [adjective] Guide to [topic]**
- **Stop [doing painful thing]. Start [doing better thing].**
- **[Outcome] for [audience] Who [situation]**

### CTAs That Work
- Start with a verb: Get, Start, Download, Join, Discover
- Add urgency: Now, Today, Before [event]
- Reduce friction: Free, No credit card, Instant access
- Be specific: "Get Your Free Guide" > "Submit"

## Common Copy Mistakes

### Avoid These
- Leading with features instead of benefits
- Using jargon your audience doesn't use
- Passive voice and weak verbs
- No clear hierarchy (everything looks the same)
- Multiple CTAs competing for attention
- Missing social proof
- Ignoring objections
- No urgency or reason to act now
- Writing for everyone (writing for no one)
- Long paragraphs without visual breaks

### Fix These Patterns
| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "We offer solutions" | "Get [specific result] in [timeframe]" |
| "Industry-leading platform" | "Used by 10,000+ teams at [logos]" |
| "Click here" | "Start your free trial" |
| "Submit" | "Get instant access" |
| "Our product helps..." | "You'll [achieve outcome]..." |

## SEO Copy Guidelines

### Title Tags
- 50-60 characters
- Primary keyword near the start
- Benefit or action included
- Brand at the end (if space)

### Meta Descriptions
- 150-160 characters
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Compelling reason to click
- Call to action

### Header Hierarchy
- H1: One per page, includes primary keyword
- H2: Section breaks, secondary keywords
- H3: Subsections, natural language

### Body Copy
- Keyword in first 100 words
- Use variations, not exact repetition
- Write for humans first, search engines second
- Internal links with descriptive anchor text
