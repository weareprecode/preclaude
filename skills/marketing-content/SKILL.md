### Step 1: Extract Key Messages

What problem does this solve and for whom?

**Key Benefits** (3 max)
Not features — outcomes the user experiences.

**Differentiators** (2-3)
What makes this unique vs alternatives?

**Proof Points**
Data, testimonials, or specifics that add credibility.

**Target Audience**
Who specifically cares about this?

### Step 2: Adapt to Platform
Each platform has different:
- Length constraints
- Tone expectations
- Engagement patterns
- Hashtag/formatting norms

### Step 3: Create Variations
Generate 2-3 options for A/B testing where applicable.

## Platform Guidelines

### Twitter/X (280 chars)

**Structure**: Hook → Value → CTA

**Patterns that work:**
- Start with a number or statistic
- Ask a question
- Make a bold claim
- Use "You" not "We"

**Format:**
```
[Hook - grabs attention]
[Value - what they get]
[CTA - what to do]

#hashtag #hashtag
```

**Thread structure (for bigger announcements):**
```
1/ [Hook that creates curiosity - no CTA yet]
2/ [The problem / status quo]
3/ [Your solution intro]
4/ [Key benefit 1]
5/ [Key benefit 2]  
6/ [Social proof if available]
7/ [CTA with link]
```

**Don'ts:**
- No "We're excited to announce..."
- No "Check out our new..."
- Avoid jargon
- Don't use all 280 chars if unnecessary

### LinkedIn (150-3000 chars, sweet spot 1200-1500)

**Structure**: Hook → Story → Insight → CTA

**Format:**
```
[Opening hook - insight, question, or bold statement]

[2-3 paragraphs building the narrative]

[Key takeaway or lesson]

[Call to action]

#hashtag #hashtag #hashtag (3-5 relevant)
```

**Patterns that work:**
- Personal stories with professional lessons
- Contrarian takes on industry norms
- "Here's what I learned from..."
- Data-backed insights
- Behind-the-scenes of building

**Engagement boosters:**
