### Commands
```bash
# In any Claude Code session
/learn              # Analyze session for CLAUDE.md updates
/commit             # Generate conventional commit
/kickoff myproject  # Initialize new project
```

# Invoke specific expertise
@frontend-developer Build a responsive navbar with mobile menu
@security-auditor Review the auth implementation for vulnerabilities
@test-engineer Write integration tests for the user API

### Skills
Skills activate automatically based on your request:
- "Convert this PRD to JSON" → triggers prd-to-json
- "Generate social media posts for this feature" → triggers marketing-content

## Customization

### Add Project-Specific Overrides
Create `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in any project to add local context that extends (not replaces) the global config.

### Add New Commands
```bash
# Create new command file
touch ~/claude-config/commands/my-command.md
```

### Modify Global Preferences
Edit `~/claude-config/CLAUDE.md` for preferences that apply everywhere.

## Sync Across Machines

This repo IS your sync mechanism. On a new machine:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/claude-config.git ~/claude-config
cd ~/claude-config
./install.sh
```

## For Claude.ai (Web)

The web interface doesn't support this structure directly. Options:

1. **Projects**: Create a "Dev Standards" project, upload skill files as knowledge
2. **Memory**: Key principles are remembered across conversations
3. **Paste**: Copy relevant skill content into conversations as needed
