# Stakeholder Update

Generate progress updates for stakeholders - daily standup notes, weekly reports, or full update packs.

## Phase 1: Determine Update Type

If $ARGUMENTS provided, use that. Otherwise, ask:

Use AskUserQuestion tool:
```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "What type of update do you need?",
    "header": "Update",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Daily update", "description": "Quick standup-style summary of today's progress"},
      {"label": "Weekly report", "description": "Full week summary with metrics and next steps"},
      {"label": "Full pack", "description": "Comprehensive stakeholder pack with screenshots and demos"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

## Phase 2: Gather Data

### Git Activity
```bash
# Commits today
git log --oneline --since="midnight" --author="$(git config user.name)" 2>/dev/null | head -10 || echo "No commits today"

# Commits this week
git log --oneline --since="1 week ago" --author="$(git config user.name)" 2>/dev/null | head -20 || echo "No commits this week"

# Files changed recently (from last 10 commits or beginning of repo)
git diff $(git rev-parse --short HEAD~10 2>/dev/null || git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD) --stat 2>/dev/null | tail -1 || echo "No changes"
```

### Project Status
```bash
# Check for PRD/stories
find . -name "prd.json" -path "*/ralph/*" 2>/dev/null | head -1

# If found, get story progress
cat scripts/ralph/prd.json 2>/dev/null | jq '{
  total: (.userStories | length),
  completed: ([.userStories[] | select(.passes == true)] | length),
  remaining: ([.userStories[] | select(.passes == false)] | length)
}' 2>/dev/null
```

### Recent Handoffs
```bash
# Find recent handoff notes
find . -name "*handoff*" -type f 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules | head -3
```
