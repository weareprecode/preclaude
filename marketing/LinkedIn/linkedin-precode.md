## Option 1: Short Post (Feed)

**We just open-sourced Preclaude.**

It's how we build MVPs in days instead of weeks.

26 slash commands. 16 specialist AI agents. An autonomous builder called Ralph that turns product specs into deployed code.

One command to install. Free forever.

Here's what changed for us:

Before Preclaude:
→ 2-3 weeks per MVP
→ Repetitive setup every project
→ Manual testing and deployment
→ Context lost between sessions

After Preclaude:
→ 2-3 days per MVP
→ Consistent workflows from day one
→ Automated quality checks
→ Knowledge compounds across projects

The secret is Ralph. It reads your PRD, breaks it into atomic user stories, implements them one by one, runs tests, commits if passing, and moves on. You review. It builds.

We've shipped 3 client MVPs, 2 internal tools, and a SaaS product in the last month using this system.

Now it's yours.

# How We Build MVPs in Days: Introducing Preclaude

**We're a UK-based digital product agency. Our speciality is rapid MVP development—taking ideas from concept to deployed product in days, not months.**

Today, we're open-sourcing the system that makes this possible: **Preclaude**.

## The Problem We Solved

Claude Code is powerful. It can write code, debug errors, refactor systems, and explain complex logic. But out of the box, it starts fresh every session.

Every project, we found ourselves:
- Re-explaining our tech stack preferences
- Repeating the same prompts for common tasks
- Manually orchestrating builds, tests, and deployments
- Losing context between sessions

We needed Claude Code to work the way we work—with established workflows, specialist knowledge, and autonomous execution.

## What Is Preclaude?

Preclaude is a pre-configured setup for Claude Code that includes:

**25 Slash Commands**
Production-ready workflows for common tasks:
- `/full-build` — Go from idea to deployed application
- `/prd` — Generate comprehensive product requirement documents
- `/commit` — Create conventional commits from staged changes
- `/review` — Comprehensive code review before PRs
- `/test` — Generate unit, integration, or E2E tests
- `/debug` — Analyse errors and get fixes
- `/status` — Health check (git, lint, types, tests in one view)
- `/deploy-check` — Pre-deployment verification checklist

**15 Specialist Agents**
Domain experts available on demand:
- `@frontend-developer` — React, Next.js, state management
- `@backend-developer` — APIs, authentication, databases
- `@database-architect` — Schema design, query optimisation
- `@security-auditor` — Vulnerability analysis, OWASP compliance
- `@test-engineer` — Testing strategies and implementation
- `@devops-engineer` — CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes
- `@performance-engineer` — Core Web Vitals, bundle analysis
- `@ui-designer` — Design systems, accessibility
- And more...

**Ralph: The Autonomous Builder**
This is where it gets interesting.

Ralph reads a structured PRD (Product Requirements Document), breaks it into atomic user stories, and builds your product story by story. For each story, it:

1. Reads the requirements
2. Implements the feature
3. Runs typecheck, lint, and tests
4. Commits if all checks pass
5. Moves to the next story
6. Repeats until complete

You set the number of iterations. Ralph builds. You review.

We've watched Ralph implement entire features while we grab coffee. It's not magic—it's systematic execution of well-defined requirements.

## Real Results

In the last month, we've used Preclaude to build:
- 3 client MVPs
- 2 internal tools
- 1 SaaS product

Average time from concept to deployed product: **2.5 days**.

A recent example: A client needed a CRM for their trades business. At 9am, we described the product in two paragraphs. By 9:15am, `/prd` had generated 24 user stories. At 9:20am, `/full-build` started Ralph. By 11:30am, we had a working MVP with 47 commits, deployed and ready for user testing.

## Why We're Open-Sourcing This

Three reasons:

1. **Rising tide lifts all boats.** Better tools make better products. Better products raise expectations. Rising expectations create more opportunity for agencies like us.

2. **Community feedback.** We've built this for our workflow. Other developers will find edge cases, suggest improvements, and contribute commands we haven't thought of.

3. **Reputation.** We want to be known as the agency that builds fast. Open-sourcing our tools proves we can.

## How To Get Started

Installation takes 30 seconds:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weareprecode/preclaude/main/install-remote.sh | bash
```

Restart Claude Code. Type `/status` to verify installation.

That's it.

**Requirements:**
- Claude Code installed
- macOS or Linux
- 30 seconds

**What you get:**
- 26 production-ready commands
- 16 specialist agents
- Ralph autonomous builder
- Full source code (MIT license)

## What's Next

We're actively developing Preclaude. On the roadmap:
- Windows support
- Additional specialist agents
- Community command marketplace
- Improved Ralph monitoring and control
- IDE integrations

## Attribution

The Ralph autonomous builder is powered by the Ralph Wiggum plugin created by Geoffrey Huntley. We've wrapped it with our workflow, but the core autonomous loop is his excellent work.

## Engagement Hooks (Use in Comments)

After posting, drop these in the comments to drive engagement:

1. "Curious which command would be most useful for your workflow? Reply and I'll explain how we use it."

2. "We're taking requests for new commands. What repetitive task do you wish was automated?"

3. "For those who've tried it—what's your first impression? Any friction in the install process?"

4. "Hot take: In 2 years, every developer will have a system like this. The ones who start now will be miles ahead."

5. "The hardest part of building Preclaude was deciding what NOT to include. Simplicity > features."
