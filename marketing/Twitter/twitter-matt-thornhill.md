## Hook Tweet

I've been using Claude Code for months. Last week I added 26 slash commands, 16 specialist agents, and an autonomous builder called Ralph.

Now I can go from idea to deployed MVP without writing a single line of code myself.

Here's how (it's free):

## Tweet 2 - The Problem

The thing about Claude Code is it's powerful but raw.

Every session I was:
- Repeating the same prompts
- Explaining my stack preferences
- Manually running builds and tests
- Context-switching between tasks

I needed a system, not just a tool.

## Tweet 3 - The Solution

So we built Preclaude.

One curl command installs:
- 26 slash commands (/commit, /review, /prd, /test...)
- 16 specialist agents (@frontend-developer, @security-auditor...)
- Ralph - an autonomous builder that implements PRDs story-by-story

All pre-configured. All production-ready.

## Tweet 4 - Ralph Demo

The game-changer is Ralph.

You give it a PRD. It:
1. Breaks it into atomic user stories
2. Implements one story per iteration
3. Runs typecheck, lint, tests
4. Commits if passing
5. Moves to the next story

I've watched it build entire features while I make coffee.

## Tweet 5 - The Commands

My most-used commands:

/full-build - idea to working app
/commit - conventional commits from staged changes
/review - code review before PRs
/test - generate tests for existing code
/debug - paste an error, get a fix
/status - health check (git, lint, types, tests)

Each one saves 10+ minutes.

## Tweet 6 - The Agents

The agents are like having a team on standby:

@frontend-developer - React, Next.js, state
@backend-developer - APIs, auth, database
@security-auditor - vulnerability analysis
@test-engineer - unit, integration, E2E
@performance-engineer - Core Web Vitals, bundle size

They bring domain expertise to every conversation.

## Tweet 7 - Real Example

Last Tuesday I built a CRM for a client.

9am: Described the product in 2 paragraphs
9:15am: /prd generated 24 user stories
9:20am: /full-build started Ralph
11:30am: Working MVP, 47 commits, deployed

I reviewed code and answered questions. That's it.

## Tweet 8 - How To Install

Install in 30 seconds:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weareprecode/preclaude/main/install-remote.sh | bash
```

Restart Claude Code.

Type /status to verify.

That's it. Free. Open source. MIT license.

## Tweet 9 - Attribution

Quick shoutout to @GeoffreyHuntley who created the Ralph Wiggum plugin that powers our autonomous builder.

We've wrapped it with our workflow but the core loop is his brilliant work.

## Tweet 10 - CTA

If you're using Claude Code without Preclaude, you're working too hard.

Install it: preclaude.com
Star it: github.com/weareprecode/preclaude
Questions: @weareprecode

What command would you add? Reply and I might build it.
