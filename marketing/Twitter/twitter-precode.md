## Tweet 2 - What Is Preclaude

Preclaude supercharges Claude Code.

Instead of starting every session from scratch, you get:
- Production-ready workflows

It's how we build MVPs in days, not weeks.

## Tweet 5 - Meet Ralph

Ralph is different.

It's an autonomous builder that:
1. Reads your PRD
2. Breaks it into user stories
3. Implements one story at a time
4. Runs quality checks
5. Commits on success
6. Repeats until done

You set iterations. Ralph builds. You review.

## Tweet 6 - Real Numbers

What we've built with Preclaude in the last month:

• 3 client MVPs
• 2 internal tools
• 1 SaaS product

Average time from idea to deployed: 2.5 days

Lines of code written manually: ~0

## Tweet 7 - Why We Open-Sourced

We're a digital product agency. We build MVPs fast.

Preclaude is how we do it.

We're open-sourcing it because:
1. Rising tide lifts all boats
2. Community feedback makes it better
3. We want to be known for this

Use it. Modify it. Ship faster.

## Alternative: Long-Form Single Post

We just open-sourced Preclaude.

26 slash commands. 16 specialist agents. An autonomous builder that turns PRDs into shipped code. One curl command. Free forever.

We're a digital product agency. This is how we build MVPs in days, not weeks.

The commands handle repetitive workflows:
• /full-build → Idea to deployed app
• /commit → Conventional commits
• /review → Code review
• /test → Generate tests
• /debug → Fix errors

The agents bring domain expertise:
• @frontend-developer
• @backend-developer
• @security-auditor
• @test-engineer
• @performance-engineer

But Ralph is the game-changer. It's an autonomous builder that reads your PRD, breaks it into stories, implements them one by one, runs tests, commits if passing, and repeats. You set iterations. Ralph builds. You review.

What we've shipped with Preclaude in the last month:
• 3 client MVPs
• 2 internal tools
• 1 SaaS product

Average time: 2.5 days per project.
